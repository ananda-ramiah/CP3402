## Learning Activities:

- I watched the lecture recording on LearnJCU from the Townsville class and the following demos video on Vagrant and Joomla.
- This week's learning resource was a deep-dive into WordPress usage and got introduced to the block based style structure. They also covered vastly the many types of media, layout and functionalities that can be displayed on WordPress.

## Content Insights:
I used the Local App, to create websites and practiced some WordPress page/post making by attempting to recreate templates from the internet.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I would usually just jump right into coding in Visual Studio without much planning and preparation. However, after using tools such as Figma and Codepen, I found it much easier to plan my work and would probably facilitate collaborative work or picking up work after a hiatus.
- It was my first time using LinkedIn Learning and I really appreciate the course structure, assessment structure, and length which kept me interested while not being too long-winded or devoid of new information. This is a great sign personally as I am aware that this course involves a lot of self-learning, especially using videos available on LinkedIn Learning. I'm thrilled to progress through this course.
- It's been a while since I have hard coded (even if partially) a website and published it. Using these tools such as Amazon Web Services and GitHub Pages was very interesting and I did some personal research on how to use them which should help me in the future.
