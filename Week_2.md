## Learning Activities:

- I watched the lecture recording on LearnJCU from the Townsville class and the following demos video on Vagrant and Joomla.

## Content Insights:
I used the Local App, to create websites and practiced some WordPress page/post making by attempting to recreate templates from the internet.
I was also introduced to a lot of different software used in the industry which I plan to try in my spare time.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I would usually just jump right into coding in Visual Studio without much planning and preparation. However, after using tools such as Figma and Codepen, I found it much easier to plan my work and would probably facilitate collaborative work or picking up work after a hiatus.
- It was my first time using LinkedIn Learning and I really appreciate the course structure, assessment structure, and length which kept me interested while not being too long-winded or devoid of new information. This is a great sign personally as I am aware that this course involves a lot of self-learning, especially using videos available on LinkedIn Learning. I'm thrilled to progress through this course.
- It's been a while since I have hard coded (even if partially) a website and published it. Using these tools such as Amazon Web Services and GitHub Pages was very interesting and I did some personal research on how to use them which should help me in the future.
