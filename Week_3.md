## Learning Activities:

- I watched the lecture recording on LearnJCU from the Townsville class which was some of the lecture and a WordPress demo.
- This week's learning resource built upon last week's resource which explained the basics of WordPress. They emphasized on specific workflows and strtegies which should result in greater efficiency when creating WordPress websites.

## Content Insights:
- The convenor is Townville used a VirtualMachine to set his WordPress which was rather intuitive and complex from my POV. I was informed that that was one of the ways to create a Linux environment so I might give it a try in the future weeks.
- In the Joomla website I made last week about an esports organization, I had planned to have highlights of our gameplay embeded in the website. However, I didn't have such content at hand and did not upload it. This week I got more information on the hosting of the types of files as they would have used my hosting plan's bandwidth.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
  - This LinkedLearning course was about something compeltely new namely WordPress but it felt very long winded compared to last week and had me a bit bored at times. I know that this is another side of self-learning but it wasn't the most fun to say the least.
  - If I am ever to use Joomla again, I will likely prefer to get training and support from a professional as I found it to be quite cumbersome and difficult to use.
