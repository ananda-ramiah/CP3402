## Learning Activities:

- I watched the lecture recording on LearnJCU from the Townsville class which was some of the lecture and a WordPress demo.
- This week's learning resource built upon last week's resource which explained the basics of WordPress. They emphasized on specific workflows and strategies which should result in greater efficiency when creating WordPress websites.
- I still used the previous method of using the Local Application by Flywheel to complete the practical locally as it seemed more intuitive.

## Resources/Links:

- LearnJCU(https://learn.jcu.edu.au/ultra/courses/_162332_1/outline)
- LinkedIn Learning(https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-workflows-2015)
- Local by FlyWheel(https://localwp.com/)

## Estimated Hours:

- 2 hours to watch the Demos/explore Lindsay's GitHub
- 3 hours for the LinkedInLearning course
- 6 hours for the Practical

## Content Insights:
- The convenor is Townville used a VirtualMachine to set his WordPress which was rather intuitive and complex from my POV. I was informed that that was one of the ways to create a Linux environment so I might give it a try in the future weeks.
- In the Joomla website I made last week about an esports organization, I had planned to have highlights of our gameplay embeded in the website. However, I didn't have such content at hand and did not upload it. This week I got more information on the hosting of the types of files as they would have used my hosting plan's bandwidth.
- I will likely used my insights from the learning resource to create and learn more about child themes in the upcoming Assignment 1.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
  - This LinkedLearning course really broke down the usage of WordPress and got me into really understanding the fascinating award winning sites which I have been browsing in my free time. This will likely require a lot more practice but I can slowly but surely see the vastness that is presented before me within web development in WordPress. The horizons seem so far away yet I might be a few plugins and edits away from creating something really great in terms of UX design.
  - This week's work is helping me have a better grasp of the many responsibilities of the programmer when working with a CMS.
